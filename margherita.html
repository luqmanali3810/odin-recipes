        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The simplest way to describe Margherita Pizza is the ingredients represent the colours of the italian flag.  </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 packet crust yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoom sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2/3 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups tomato</li>
            <li>6 ounces buffalo mozzarella</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Direction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the oil and 2/3 cup of water. </li>
            <li>Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead the mixture, adding more flour if the dough is too sticky, until the surface is smooth and elastic, 4 to 6 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Drizzle a rimmed sheet pan or pre-heated pizza stone with oil. Roll out the dough and place it on the pan. Top with the tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil, salt, pepper and a bit more oil. </li>
            <li>Bake the pizza until the crust is golden and the toppings are bubbling, about 15 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of your crust.</li>
            
        </ol>
